# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that facilitates communication between two existing systems by providing a compatible interface. It acts as a bridge between systems with incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

## Explanation

- **Existing Systems**: Suppose we have two existing systems, a laptop with USB ports and a printer with parallel port.
- **Adapter Interface**: The Adapter pattern introduces an adapter class that implements a common interface compatible with both the laptop and the printer.
- **Communication Facilitation**: The adapter class mediates communication between the laptop and the printer by converting the USB interface of the laptop into a parallel port interface that the printer expects.
- **Transparent Integration**: With the adapter in place, the laptop and the printer can seamlessly interact with each other through the common interface provided by the adapter, without needing to modify their own interfaces.

## Example: USB to Parallel Port Adapter

Suppose we have a modern laptop with USB ports, and we want to connect it to an old printer that only has a parallel port. The laptop and the printer have incompatible interfaces, but we can use an adapter to bridge the gap.

- **Laptop (Client)**: The laptop has USB ports and expects devices to be connected via USB interface.
- **Printer (Adaptee)**: The printer has a parallel port interface and cannot directly connect to the laptop's USB port.

To facilitate communication between the laptop and the printer, we introduce a USB to Parallel Port Adapter (Adapter):

- **Adapter Interface**: The USB to Parallel Port Adapter implements a common interface that is compatible with both the laptop's USB port and the printer's parallel port.
- **Adapter Implementation**: The adapter converts the USB signals from the laptop into signals that the printer's parallel port can understand, effectively translating between the two interfaces.
- **Usage**: With the adapter in place, the laptop can connect to the printer via USB, and the adapter handles the necessary conversion to ensure seamless communication between the two devices.

The Adapter pattern allows us to integrate legacy devices (such as the old printer with a parallel port) with modern systems (such as the laptop with USB ports) without the need for extensive modifications to either system. By providing a compatible interface, the adapter promotes interoperability and enables the effective use of existing hardware with newer technologies.
