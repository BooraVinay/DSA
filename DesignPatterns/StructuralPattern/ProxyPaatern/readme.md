# Proxy Design Pattern

## Overview

The proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern involves creating a class (the proxy) that acts as an intermediary between a client and the real object, allowing the proxy to add functionality or provide a different interface to the real object.

## Main Features

- **Wrapper for Real Subject**: The proxy class wraps the real subject class, providing a layer of indirection.

- **Polymorphic Design**: Both the proxy and real subject classes adhere to the same interface, allowing clients to interact with them interchangeably.

- **Lazy Loading**: A lightweight proxy is used instead of a resource-intensive object until it is actually needed, improving performance and resource management.

- **Intelligent Verification**: The proxy implements intelligent verification of requests from client code to determine how and to whom requests should be forwarded.

- **Remote Representation**: The proxy can present a local representation of a system that is not in the same physical or virtual space as the client.

## Benefits

- **Indirection**: Provides a powerful means of indirection, allowing for additional control and functionality.

- **Robustness**: Proxy classes are robust and can enhance system security by controlling access to the real object.

- **Resource Efficiency**: Allows for the creation of systems that are more resource-efficient by deferring the creation of resource-intensive objects until necessary.

## Example

Consider an application where a proxy is used to access a remote service. The proxy handles authentication, caching, and load balancing, while the real service performs the actual business logic.

```python
class Proxy:
    def request(self):
        if self.authenticate():
            response = self.real_service.request()
            self.cache(response)
            return response
        else:
            return "Authentication failed."
    
    def authenticate(self):
        # Logic for authentication
        pass
    
    def cache(self, response):
        # Logic for caching
        pass

class RealService:
    def request(self):
        # Actual business logic
        pass
